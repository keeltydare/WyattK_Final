                TOBY THE GHOST
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Unfortunately, like most camps, we are haunted. However, our ghost is very friendy, and enjoys
                participating in all of our camp activities. His name is Toby. His favorite color is red.
            </h3>
            <h3>
                We aren’t certain how long he has been here, but camp records do not suggest that he is one of our past
                campers. He can usually be spotted in a white sheet with red rainboots. We promise he doesn’t mean you
                any harm; he’s enjoying his time at Climb That Mountain Summer Camp, just like the rest of us.

                Sometimes Toby will join us during our Friday Night Campfire Jam. He loves playing ukulele, and will
                often sing some old time favorites, like Riptide and Somewhere over the Rainbow.

                If you ever notice that there aren’t any red popsicles left, no need to worry. It’s Toby’s favorite
                snack. He knows he shouldn’t be hoarding them, but he always tries to anyway.

                Toby enjoys spooky stories as much as the next spirit, but he seems to follow a strict bedtime of 10 pm,
                so don’t expect him to join in if you and your bunkmates are telling stories into the wee hours of the
                morning. And don’t go looking for him late at night, either. He doesn’t enjoy being woken up.

                We hope you learn to love Toby’s company as much as we do. He’s stuck with you, as much as you are with
                him, so please be nice. Perhaps you’ll make a new spectral friend!
